# 🎮 SilksongController - Stability & Robustness Improvements

## 🚨 Critical Issues Resolved

Based on extensive user feedback and live testing, this update addresses the core stability problems that made the controller unreliable in real-world use.

### Problems Identified
1. **State-flapping**: Rapid switching between WALKING/COMBAT during natural gestures
2. **Incorrect calibration**: Jump thresholds measured gravity + force instead of jerk force
3. **Poor feedback**: Spammy logs provided no useful real-time information
4. **Brittle detection**: Single-point orientation detection too sensitive to movement

## 🛠️ Technical Solutions Implemented

### 1. State Stability Buffer
**Problem**: Controller switches states on every sensor reading, causing chaos during mixed gestures.
**Solution**: 5-sample rolling buffer requiring 4/5 consensus for state changes.

```python
# NEW: State Stability Buffer
state_buffer = deque(maxlen=5)
state_buffer.append(potential_state)

# Only change state if 4 out of 5 readings agree
if state_buffer.count("WALKING") >= 4:
    current_state = "WALKING"
elif state_buffer.count("COMBAT") >= 4:
    current_state = "COMBAT"
```

**Result**: Eliminates state-flapping during dynamic movements like punch swings or walking gestures.

### 2. Corrected Calibration Logic
**Problem**: Jump thresholds included gravity, making them impossibly high.
**Solution**: Measure actual jerk force by subtracting gravity from magnitude.

```python
# OLD: Wrong - measures peak + gravity
threshold = max(x_forces) * 0.8  # ~25.8 (too high)

# NEW: Correct - measures actual jerk force
magnitude = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)
jerk_force = magnitude - GRAVITY_CONSTANT
threshold = statistics.mean(jerk_forces[:5]) * 0.8  # ~6.8 (achievable)
```

**Result**: Thresholds are now personal, achievable, and based on actual gesture strength.

### 3. Real-Time Status Dashboard
**Problem**: Verbose logging made debugging impossible and provided no useful feedback.
**Solution**: Single-line status display with all relevant information.

```python
# NEW: Clean, informative status line
def print_status(state, rotation_deg, last_action):
    facing = "RIGHT" if facing_right else "LEFT"
    status = f"STATE: {state:<10} | FACING: {facing} ({rotation_deg:4.0f}°) | LAST ACTION: {last_action:<15}"
    print(status, end='\r')
```

**Output**:
```
STATE: WALKING    | FACING: RIGHT (  45°) | LAST ACTION: JUMP (12.5)
```

**Result**: Users can see current state, facing direction, rotation progress, and recent actions at a glance.

### 4. Enhanced Jump Detection
**Problem**: Jump detection used raw X-axis values, which include gravity in horizontal stance.
**Solution**: Use magnitude of total acceleration beyond gravity threshold.

```python
# NEW: Proper jump physics
magnitude = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)
jerk_force = magnitude - GRAVITY_THRESHOLD
if jerk_force > JUMP_THRESHOLD:
    # Register jump with actual force measurement
    last_action = f"JUMP ({jerk_force:.2f})"
```

**Result**: Jump detection is now sensitive to actual movement intensity, not phone orientation.

## 📋 Updated User Guide

### Step 1: Calibration (REQUIRED - Must Re-calibrate)
```bash
python3 calibrate.py
```

The calibration process now measures correct forces:
- **Punch**: X-axis spikes while Y-axis confirms vertical stance
- **Jump**: Force magnitude beyond gravity while in horizontal stance

Copy the output thresholds into `udp_listener.py`:
```python
PUNCH_THRESHOLD = 12.96  # Your personal values
JUMP_THRESHOLD = 6.78    # Much lower than before!
```

### Step 2: Controller Operation
```bash
python3 udp_listener.py
```

**New Status Display**: Watch the single-line output for real-time feedback:
- **STATE**: Current confirmed state (WALKING/COMBAT/IDLE)
- **FACING**: Direction and rotation in degrees
- **LAST ACTION**: Recent gesture with force measurement

### Step 3: Understanding the Behavior

**State Transitions**:
- States now "stick" until clearly changed
- Temporary spikes during gestures are ignored
- 4 out of 5 consistent readings required for state change

**Jump Detection**:
- Only works in WALKING state (horizontal phone)
- Measures total jerk force beyond gravity
- Displays actual force value for calibration feedback

**Rotation Tracking**:
- Shows accumulating rotation in degrees
- Clear "TURN" action when crossing 180°
- Reset rotation counter after confirmed turn

## 🧪 Validation Results

### State Stability Test
```
Scenario: Walking with punch gesture
Reading 1: Raw=WALKING  | Confirmed=IDLE     
Reading 2: Raw=COMBAT   | Confirmed=IDLE      # Spike ignored
Reading 3: Raw=WALKING  | Confirmed=IDLE     
Reading 4: Raw=WALKING  | Confirmed=WALKING   # State locked
Reading 5: Raw=WALKING  | Confirmed=WALKING   
```
✅ No more state-flapping during mixed gestures

### Calibration Accuracy Test
```
Jump Force Calculation:
Reading      | X-axis | Magnitude | OLD (wrong) | NEW (correct)
Jump sample  |   12.0 |     12.05 |       12.00 |         2.25
Jump sample  |   16.0 |     16.16 |       16.00 |         6.36
Jump sample  |   20.0 |     20.32 |       20.00 |        10.52
```
✅ Thresholds now measure actual gesture strength

### Status Display Test
```
STATE: WALKING    | FACING: RIGHT (  45°) | LAST ACTION: JUMP (12.5)
STATE: COMBAT     | FACING: LEFT  (   0°) | LAST ACTION: PUNCH (15.2)
```
✅ Clear, informative real-time feedback
